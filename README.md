# Line-Follower
A line follower here uses an IR sensor to sense the light reflections and move and turn according to the prescribed tracked.

It uses an IR sensor for sensing the light.
DC Motors for movement.
Bredt Board for electronic circuitries.
Arduino as a microcontroller.

The code is pure C++ program that works in sync with an arduino code that gets the Line follower ready.
